WHAT IS INTELLIGENT CONTENT?

Simply put, ‘intelligent content’ is content which is not limited to one purpose,
technology or output. It’s content that is structurally rich and semantically aware,
and is therefore discoverable, reusable, reconfigurable and adaptable. It’s
content that helps you and your customers get the job done. It’s content that
works for you and it’s limited only by your imagination. Learn more about intelligent
content and how it can benefit your organization.
